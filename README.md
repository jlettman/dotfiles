âŒ‚ [John Lettman](mailto:John Lettman <jlettman@aethon.com>) GNU/Linux dotfiles
==============================================================================

This repository contains personalized configuration files (dotfiles) for working
in a GNU/Linux environment on Golang, PHP, Python, C, C++, Shell scripts, and
IT management. It is managed using the
["Yet Another Dotfiles Manager" (yadm)](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/)
tool.

In the current state it is highly specific to portions of my identity; however,
individual configuration options may be very useful to those wishing to match
my development and security setup.

Files of note include:

- [Visual Studio Code settings](.config/Code/User/settings.json)
- [GNU Privacy Guard settings](.gnupg/gpg.conf)
- [Zsh initialization](.zshrc) and [Zsh profile environment](.zprofile)
